# Counter App
This React app allows users to increment and reset counters. Each counter starts at zero, and the background color changes upon incrementing or resetting the count. Users can delete individual counters, and the app dynamically manages multiple counters using state. The App component holds an array of counters, while the Counter component manages each counter's functionality (increment, reset, and delete).
